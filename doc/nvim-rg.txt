INTRODUCTION                                    *nvim-rg*

nvim-rg allows you to run ripgrep from Neovim or Vim and shows the results in a
quickfix window. It was developed for use on macOS with Neovim. On Neovim, it
runs asynchronously.

COMMANDS                                        *nvim-rg-commands*

                                                *:Rg*
:Rg [options] {pattern} [{directory}]
                        Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to
                        the current directory) for the {pattern}.

:Rg                     When run without arguments, you will be prompted for a
                        pattern, directory, and file type.


<leader>rg              Same as :Rg

<leader>rw              Search for the word under the cursor.
